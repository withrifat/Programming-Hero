# Introduction to JavaScript

## Variables

Variables are used to store data values. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const`. For example:

```js
let age = 25;
const name = 'Alice';
```

## JavaScript Keywords & Variable Naming

JavaScript has reserved keywords like `let`, `const`, `if`, `else`, etc., which cannot be used as variable names. Variable names should be meaningful, start with a letter, `$`, or `_`, and cannot contain spaces.

## Fundamentals

JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for web development. It allows you to create interactive websites, handle user input, and manipulate web page content.

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical calculations:

- `+` Addition
- `-` Subtraction
- `*` Multiplication
- `/` Division
- `%` Modulus (remainder)

Example:

```js
let sum = 10 + 5; // 15
let product = 4 * 3; // 12
```

## Advanced Mathematical Operations

JavaScript provides built-in methods for advanced math operations through the `Math` object:

- `Math.pow(x, y)` for exponentiation
- `Math.sqrt(x)` for square root
- `Math.abs(x)` for absolute value
- `Math.round(x)` for rounding

Example:

```js
let square = Math.pow(3, 2); // 9
let root = Math.sqrt(16);
```
