## CSS Units and Responsiveness
- Use **relative CSS units** like `vmin`, `vmax`, `rem`, and `%` for flexible and scalable layouts.
- These units help in creating **responsive designs** that adapt to different screen sizes.

## Responsive Design Techniques
- Utilize **`display: flex`** and **`display: grid`** to create responsive layouts.
- Include the **viewport meta tag** in HTML to control layout on mobile browsers:

  ```html
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
Layout Best Practices
Set a max-width on the body to limit content width on large screens.

Use horizontal center alignment (e.g., margin: 0 auto) to keep content centered.

Make images fluid by setting max-width: 100% and height: auto to scale with their containers.

Flexbox Layout
Create a two-column layout using flexbox.

Use media queries to change flex-direction to column on smaller screens for better stacking.

Grid Layout
Implement multi-column grid layouts for complex, two-dimensional arrangements.

Grid offers control over both rows and columns.

Responsive Menu
For responsive navigation menus, JavaScript is often needed to toggle menu visibility or expand/collapse menus on smaller screens.

Grid vs Flexbox Differentiation
Feature	Flexbox	Grid
Dimension	One-dimensional (row or column)	Two-dimensional (rows and columns)

Item placement	Flow-based, order can be changed	Precise placement with grid lines
Responsive design	Easy for simple responsiveness	Powerful for advanced grid layouts

This note summarizes key concepts and best practices for building responsive website layouts using CSS Flexbox and Grid.
